# Learning Python

Thanks to Nic (a CS PhD at XJTLU) for giving me first amazing experience with Python and Machine Learning! What impressed me is that in this course, I'm not allowed to use the 3rd party libraries. Writing ML algorithm from scratch helps me have a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics.
